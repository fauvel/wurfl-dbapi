- Introduced SimpleDesktop Matching Engine which increases detection speed for desktop browsers by 10x from version 2.0.0, while reducing the cache size by caching all desktop user agents in one cache entry
- Introduced Capability Filtering which allows you to increase performance and drastically cut the size of your database. Capability Filtering lets you decide which capabilities you want to use from the WURFL file and ignores the rest. For example, if you only want to use Tera-WURFL to redirect mobile visitors, you only need to use the is_wireless_device capability, so you can set CAPABILITY_FILTER = array("is_wireless_device"); and only that capability will be stored in the database, instead of the 500+ capabilities that normally exist

- NOTE: you need the CREATE PROCEDURE and EXECUTE permissions as of this release
- Tested many different methods to increase speed of initial detection
- Fixed numerous typos

[2009.11.01] Pre-Release 2.0.0 RC5
- Spent a week sifting through 30,000 unique user agents over and over again while making adjustments to the UserAgentMatchers. The device detection is now extremely accurate. Not only will it detect mobile devices accurately, it is also very good at differentiating between wireless and non wireless devices. Here are the major changes:
- User Agent Matchers have been very finely tuned, re-ordered, removed and added to improve both performance and accuracy.
- PCRE Regular Expression Matching has been introduced to allow for greater flexibility and accuracy in UserAgentMatchers and the UserAgentFactory.
- Online WURFL Updating is back thanks to the ZipArchive package. This package is included with PHP >= 5.2.0. For previous versions of PHP it is available from PECL. As a last resort, Tera-WURFL will attempt to use gunzip to extract the WURFL file from the downloaded archive.
- User Agent Matcher History information is now available via TeraWurfl->capabilities['tera_wurfl']['matcher_history'] - this allows you to see the logic flow that went behind deciding which device this is. Here's an example:
- User Agent: Alcatel-OT-280/1.0 model-orange ObigoInternetBrowser/Q03C Matcher History: AlcatelUserAgentMatcher(exact), AlcatelUserAgentMatcher(conclusive), AlcatelUserAgentMatcher(recovery), CatchAllUserAgentMatcher(recovery) This shows that the User Agent was assigned the Alcatel Matcher, but after looking for an exact match, a conclusive match and a recovery match, no match could be found - therefore the CatchAll Matcher was used to make a last-resort desicion.
- Performance VS. WURFL PHP API. I ran 23902 user agents through both Tera-WURFL and the new WURFL PHP API and here are the results (caching enabled on both, same wurfl.xml used):
- Tera-WURFL Total Time: 12.081017971039 sec Devices Processed: 23902 Total Queries: 23912
- WURFL PHP API Total Time: 217.57795381546 sec Devices Processed: 23902 Total Queries: N/A
- As you can see, Tera-WURFL is still the best choice for accuracy and performance. Tera-WURFL may be even faster than these number indicate since the WURFL PHP API was benefiting greatly from my Samsung SSD.
- Hardware used for testing: Dell Studio XPS Laptop, Core 2 Duo 2.8GHz, 4GB DDR2, 256GB Samsung SSD, Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate x64, WampServer 2.0 (Apache 2.2.11, PHP 5.3.0, MySQL 5.1.36)

[2009.10.26] Pre-Release 2.0.0 RC4
- Rewrote some of the UserAgentMatchers and deleted others to bring Tera-WURFL on par with the Java WURFL API. With the introduction of desktop browser UserAgentMatchers, we no longer need to use the large web patch; instead, you can just use the 8KB one from wurfl.sourceforge.net (included). Also, I fixed some typos and bugs here and there. NOTE: if you are upgrading from version 2.0.0 RC1-RC3 you should delete all your database tables before you update. You can leave the terawurflcache table if you want to retain your cache. Although it will still technically work even if you don't delete the tables, you will be orphaning some unecessary tables in your database.

[2009.10.20] Pre-Release 2.0.0 RC3
- Complete code-rewrite from the ground up. The 2.x version of Tera-WURFL is loosely based on a pre-release of the Java WURFL Evolution Library, but the API is taken from Tera-WURFL 1.5.2. The following is a list of features found in Tera-WURFL 2.0:
- User Agent Matchers have been created for each of the major manufacturers. These allow for specific matching methods to be applied to the user agent like string searching, RIS (Reduction in String) and LD (Levenshtein Distance).
- Multiple patch files are now supported. Tera-WURFL ships with the current wurfl.xml, web_browsers_patch.xml and custom_web_patch.xml. Patch files can be added to TeraWurflConfig.php by separating them with semicolons in the TeraWurflConfig::PATCH_FILE directive. Patch files are loaded in order from left to right on top of the WURFL file, so if you want to override every other patch file, specify it last.
- The custom_web_patch.xml file can be edited from the Web Administration page, and allows you to easily add non-mobile user agents to the patch file. The devices with these user agents will be detected as generic_web_browser (non-mobile).
- Persistent Caching means that your cached devices stay cached. When you update the WURFL file or your patches, your device cache is also updated via the new database.
- Cache Browser allows you to see what devices are hitting your site and what their capabilities were detected as.
- Installation Script is better than 1.5.2. Once you download Tera-WURFL and extract it, edit TeraWurflConfig.php then go to /admin/install.php and follow the directions to finish installation.
- PHP short_open_tags are no longer required to run Tera-WURFL. PHP has this feature disabled by default now.
- Conclusive vs. Inconclusive Matching. If a device is matched with the UserAgentMatcher's primary matching method it is considered a conclusive match, if it is detected via a recovery matcher or by the CatchAllMatcher it is an inconclusive match. This information is available via the tera_wurfl capability group.
- tera_wurfl Capability Group. The TeraWurfl->Capabilities array now contains a group called "tera_wurfl". This group contains the following Tera-WURFL related information:
  - num_queries - the number of database queries required to lookup the device.
  - actual_root_device - the WURFL ID of the actual device (not subrevision or generic), this can be null.
  - match_type - either conclusive or inconclusive.
  - matcher - the name of the UserAgentMatcher that detected the device.
  - match - whether or not there was an actual match. If there was no match, Tera-WURFL guessed which generic device is most similar to the device.
  - lookup_time - the time in seconds that it took to detect the device.
  - fall_back_tree - the complete fallback tree that built the capabilities of the device. This is a list of all the WURFL IDs from the detected device down to the base generic device.

[2007.07.27] Stable 1.5.2
- Introduced a smart installation script to help you get Tera-WURFL up and running fast!
- getDeviceCapabilitiesFromAgent() function now returns boolean true (match) or false (no match).
- Introduced "MATCH_TO_UA_PREFIX" if true, matching will stop if the user agent prefix cannot be matched. The user agent prefix is everything from the beginning of the UA to the first '/', like "SonyEricssonK700i". If this is not matched in the WURFL, there searching will stop.
- Introduced "RETURN_GENERIC" if true, the user agent and accept headers will be used to determine if this device iswireless or not and the capabilities array will be populated with appropriate generic data. This IS considered a match. Set this to false to stop getting generic matches.
- Introduced webservice.php which can be used to query the Tera-WURFL database via an HTTP request. The results are returned in XML. This is a BETA feature, but it is very safe. There are details and example in the head of the file.
- Re-wrote the README file - now it has very clear instructions on usage and installation.
- Now Tera-WURFL includes the web browsers patch by default so you can tell Mobile and Non-Mobile devices apart.
- Cleaned up some minor logging issues.
- Completely re-wrote the UA matching system, scrapping a lot of unnecessary code that was wasting time!

[2007.05.09] Stable 1.5.1
- Fixed a bug that prevented the updating system from working correctly over the web. 
- If you have version 1.5.0 you can delete line 266 from the file tera_wurfl_parser.php and it will function the same as 1.5.1.

[2007.04.27] Stable 1.5.0
- Introduced a MySQL caching system - many thanks to Andrea Trasatti for his help!
- Fixed a PHP5 typecasting error while loading data in tera_wurfl_parser.php (thanks Mait Vilbiks and everyone else!)
- Fixed a PHP5 syntax error in the log_error() function (thanks Michal Albrecht!)
- Introduced a lite version that does not include the 800+ device images or the wurfl.xml file. This is only a 32k download and one it's installed you can update the wurfl.xml from the admin page.
- After much testing and some decent market penetration I have deemed this class "Stable".

[2006.12.26] Beta 1.4.4
